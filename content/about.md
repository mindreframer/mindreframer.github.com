<p>My name is Roman Heinrich, I write code. I'm doing it since 1994, when I first got my hands on a Apple Macintosh Classic II with hyper-easy and fun
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard + HyperTalk</a>
 language.</p>

<p>Nowadays I write mostly Ruby, play with GO, Clojure, JavaScript and automate my servers with Chef or Puppet.</p>

<p>I don't tweet much, or share my dinner photos on facebook, sorry, I'm kinda more reserved person. But I like to write, and this is the place for it. Hope you'll like it.</p>
