<p>Hi, I'm Roman and I am a software engineer</p>

<p>I don't ask for permission to think differently, that is my basic right</p>
<p>I fail quite a lot, but that is the only way to test boundaries</p>

<p>I love to tinker, try new ideas, experiment with things, break them apart, put them together</p>
<p>I love to ship things and I love to be around other 'shippers'</p>
<p>I fix things and sometimes I also break things...</p>
<p>I like moving fast, this overcomes inertia and generates energy</p>
<p>I help my team to deliver great maintainable products on time, fostering personal growth and culture of sharing</p>
<p>I constantly question my past experiences and re-evaluate it from new perspectives</p>
<p>I prefer concepts over concrete frameworks, simplicity over new trendy fads</p>
<p></p>
