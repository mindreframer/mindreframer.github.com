<p>Hi, I'm Roman and I am a software engineer</p>

<p>I help my team to deliver great maintainable products on time, fostering personal growth and culture of sharing</p>

<p>I fix things</p>

<p>I love to tinker, try new ideas, experiment with things, break them apart, put them together</p>

<p>I fail quite a lot, but that is the only way to test boundaries</p>

<p>I move fast, speed is an unfair advantage</p>

<p>I don't ask for permission to think differently</p>

<p>I re-evaluate my know-how quite a lot, and the only thing that is consistent is the change of things</p>

<p>I prefer concepts over concrete frameworks, simplicity over new trendy fads</p>

<p>I'd love to hear from you and your unique challenges, if you appreciate good engineering work!</p>

<!--My name is Roman Heinrich, I write code. I'm doing it since 1994, when I first got my hands on a Apple Macintosh Classic II with hyper-easy and fun

 language.</p>

<p>Nowadays I write mostly Ruby, play with GO, Clojure, JavaScript and automate my servers with Chef or Puppet.</p>

<p>I don't tweet much, or share my dinner photos on facebook, sorry, I'm kinda more reserved person. But I like to write, and this is the place for it. Hope you'll like it.</p>
