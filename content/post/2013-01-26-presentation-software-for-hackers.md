# Presentation Software

- [RevealJS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) - best!

#### Ruby
- [Showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff)
  ShowOff is a Sinatra web app that reads simple configuration files for a presentation. It is sort of like a Keynote web app engine - think S5 + Slidedown. I am using it to do all my talks in 2010, because I have a deep hatred in my heart for Keynote and yet it is by far the best in the field.

- [Terminal Keynote](https://github.com/fxn/tkn )
  Terminal Keynote is a quick and dirty script I wrote for presenting my talks at BaRuCo 2012 and RailsClub 2012.

- [Slider](https://github.com/dgoodlad/slider)
  Slider is a simple Ruby module to allow a presenter to create and view a
  slideshow using only a terminal emulator. It requires the use of the console
  application 'figlet' to draw the fancy headings.

- [tpp - text presentation program](https://github.com/cbbrowne/tpp)


#### Node.js/Javascript
- [RevealJS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) - best!

- [CoderDeck](https://github.com/cykod/CoderDeck)

  CoderDeck combines Deck.js with the CodeMirror2 highlighting code editor to make it easy to demo and teach live HTML, CSS and Javascript directly in the browser.

- [CSSS](https://github.com/LeaVerou/CSSS)
  CSS-based SlideShow System
