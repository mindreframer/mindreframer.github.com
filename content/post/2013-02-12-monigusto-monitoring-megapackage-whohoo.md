[Monigusto]

The [Monigusto] project aims to provide the equivalent of vagrant up but for monitoring and logging:

A single server box that contains the most common/current tools for monitoring like graphite, statsd, collectd, nagios, logstash, jmxtrans, tasseo , gdash , librato and sensu . Then it becomes easy for a developer to get used to the management and monitoring and without the hassle of setting it up from scratch or finding out how to make it work together
