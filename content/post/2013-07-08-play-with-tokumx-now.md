Hey there, do you want to play with TokuMX - a MongoDB fork with

  - transactions
  - ACID
  - high compression
  - better indexing than pure mongodb ?

Then wait no further! Grab your beloved Vagrant, and give this new, very promising
Fractal-Tree-based database a try, you might witness something rather revolutionary!


All the hard work is already done, just execute

    $ git clone git://github.com/mindreframer/vagrant-tokumx-puppet.git
    $ cd vagrant-tokumx-puppet
    $ vagrant up


and drink a beer! You've earned it! :)
