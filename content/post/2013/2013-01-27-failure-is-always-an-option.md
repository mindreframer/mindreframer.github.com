A couple of notes, I found worth remembering (those are not quotations...):

- [#Hangops](http://hangops.com/) or [@hangops](https://twitter.com/hangops) -
  a Google Hangout group for DevOps peeps, great!


- [Ops-School](http://www.opsschool.org/en/latest/) [source](https://github.com/opsschool/curriculum) - a growing list of things, an operations engineer is
expected to know


- Tackling the problem of failure - see it as opportunity.
- `Hindsight-bios dude` -  yeah, some failures are rationalized after they occurred...
- If something happens, take charge of it and move on.
- Tooling is still important part of if, enable things to be done easily
- Tooling is just an enabler for the cultural shift in the group
- `#shareops` - share your experience
- Blog about your operations + do public postmortems
