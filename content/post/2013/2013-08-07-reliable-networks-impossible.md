2 huge articles from Kyle about network partions and how it affects software vendors and online companies:


- [Jepsen: Testing the Partition Tolerance of PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB and Riak](http://www.infoq.com/articles/jepsen)

- [The network is reliable](http://aphyr.com/posts/288-the-network-is-reliable)

  Wow... a long list of outages due to network partitions from various companes like:
    - Github
    - Google
    - Bonsai.io
    - Amazon AWS
    - CityCloud
    - Fog Creek
    - Freistil IT
    - PagerDuty
    - CloudFlare
    .... and many more.

A very well researched article by Kyle Kingsbury, addressing the topic how hard it is to implement reliable distributed systems.
