Great ideas in line with Chads [Trash Your Servers and Burn Your Code](http://chadfowler.com/blog/2013/06/23/immutable-deployments/).

Dont grow attached to your servers! They should be replaceable and disposable units in your architecture, Lego blocks, not entities with cute names and personality... But we humans tend to get sentimental about things we have to deal with, and computers, that DO stuff, seem a bit like living beings with personality and emotional spikes.
