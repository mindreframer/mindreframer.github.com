## Week #18 (2014) linkdump:


### Networking:
  - [Postman â€“ A command-line utility for batch-sending email](https://github.com/zachlatta/postman) - made in Golang

### General:
  - [TDD, Straw Men, and Rhetoric](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/blog/2014/tdd-straw-men-and-rhetoric) - a rather long answer to DHHs rant about TDD. I have to agree on most of the points, DHH seems to have lost it... He should keep on racing and not making such absurd statements about curent state of software development.

### Javascript
