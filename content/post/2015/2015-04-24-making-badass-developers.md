Kathy Sierra drops magic wisdom!

- Treat your devs as People, not humanoids or unicorns!
- Save cognitive resources on everything, that is ONE SINGLE POOL!
- fasten up the process to get from "can't do" to "mastered"
- bypass B -> this is magic. High quantitative exposure to high quality code let's the brain recognize patterns and learn much faster. JUST EXPOSURE! We should definetelly use this!


Very excited about possible applications of this advice.
