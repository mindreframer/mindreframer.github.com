I quit when I'm forced to be responsible for something, that I am not allowed to fix.

What is leadership? Usually this has a notion of power, "I'm a leader of men", but true leadership is much more.



>>>>>>>>>
Was your leadership given to you by somebody in power? Well, then it can be taken and this is not true leadership. Can you lead people, if they don't follow? Of course not! So true leadership is organic, you convince people by the nature of your experience / knowledge / expertise / mental or physical power to agree with you on certain things, to follow your advice.
This is an important distinction, you dont order them to follow you, otherwise it is a dictatorship.

You act in their interest, so true leadership is self-less, the "WE" is more important, than I. You empower people by helping them to overcome challenges. You are the helping hand, the guiding light.

Then you can become a true leader.
