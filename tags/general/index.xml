      <description>It seems like I was under water for 2 years&amp;hellip; I became a father of a very active boy and at the same time I have shifted my professional focus to many new and very differnt things&amp;hellip; It is still not quite clear to me what long-term effect that will have in my life, but my horizon widened drastically&amp;hellip;
Elixir, Clojure, Golang&amp;hellip; Those three languages dominated my attention recently. United by first class concurrency constructs, they are very different in their philosophies.</description>

      <description>Hello, this year I will try to be consistently blogging. There are many things, that float around in my head, and I hope to get them in good shape by blogging about them. This will also remind me of myself later, because I don&amp;rsquo;t use facebook or other social networks and my online presence is mostly professional. Here will be more stuff later.</description>
